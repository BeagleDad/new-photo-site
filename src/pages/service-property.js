          Don't forget I am <strong>Supra eKEYÂ® Certified</strong> so I can access
          your properties via the lockbox, and take the photos, so you don't

        For the interior photos I use multiple off-camera flash units to fill
        the rooms with quality light. This prevents dark corners and shows off
        the true color of the rooms. I shoot most rooms from multiple angles to
        show the layout and features of each room.

        The exterior shots are framed to showcase the form of the home as well
        as the relationship with its surroundings. I shoot from many angles in
        order to make sure to capture all the amenities of the property.
